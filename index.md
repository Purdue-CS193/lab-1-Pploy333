## Sam's first CS193 Lab
I like that I get to have hands on experience with applications in a classroom environment with available help.
I like that this isnt a lecture and I get to actually do something.
I also like the Hacker Theme
This is my first lab so sadly I do not have too many favorite things yet :(
